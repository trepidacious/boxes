macwidgets is great, but there is still a memory leak with the call in SkinnableScrollBarUI to WindowUtils.installJComponentRepainterOnWindowFocusChanged(scrollbar); This sets up a listener to the containing JFrame that is never cleared, and retains components that use the scrollbars. Hence I have built a jar from SVN r401, with this line commented out - this fixes the memory leak.
