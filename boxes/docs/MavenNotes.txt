We can avoid the need to mess too much with maven by installing any extra required jars to a local repository directly in the project.
We do this by setting up the local repo (see repositories in the pom.xml - note that building after adding this will create the folder, this can be confusing!), 
and then installing jar files to this from the command line, using the following commands 
(for more details see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2229757/maven-add-a-dependency-to-a-jar-by-relative-path):

Examples for macwidgets and forms - note that you can get the local repository path from eclipse by viewing properties of the lifttest-local-repo folder in package explorer:

mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.3.1:install-file -Dfile=mac_widgets-0.9.5.401.jar -DgroupId=macwidgets -DartifactId=macwidgets -Dversion=0.9.5.401 -Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=/Users/trepidacious/Documents/mavenboxes/boxes/boxes-local-repo
mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.3.1:install-file -Dfile=lib/forms-1.2.1.jar -DgroupId=forms -DartifactId=forms -Dversion=1.2.1 -Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=/Users/trepidacious/Documents/mavenboxes/boxes/boxes-local-repo
                         
Blank example:                         
                         
mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.3.1:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file> -DgroupId=<myGroup> -DartifactId=<myArtifactId> -Dversion=<myVersion> -Dpackaging=<myPackaging> -DlocalRepositoryPath=<path>

Then reference the libraries as normal in the pom file. Note that if they have any dependencies, you will need to add these separately to the pom.xml, since
our local jar files don't have their own onward dependencies. A good place to start is any existing pom file for an older version of the jar, etc.

Finally, if having trouble with maven complaining about things being out of date/not available, and waiting for a timeout, try running the mvn commandline with an added "-U" at the start, to force an update.
